# warpwallet-script
just the warpwallet generator as a simple nodejs script

simply took what was embedded in [memwallet](https://dvdbng.github.io/memwallet/memwallet_0.1_SHA256_0852b3d886ac5df6e4b34f2224019b96620aa6619b61660801d88f7c38d07dbb.html) script and made it simple to use from the command line

just download the walletGenerator.js file and run:

`node walletGenerator.js btc` 

or for ethereum:

`node walletGenerator.js eth`

should not require any outside nodejs deps!
